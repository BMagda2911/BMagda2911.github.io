# captstone-portfolio-v2

For my Capstone portfolio, I have mainly used Bootstrap 4 and the classic HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript.
I have repurposed the baguetteBox plugin which I had to use on Project 5 of my Techdegree (an interactive photo gallery).

Credits go to:

- https://feimosi.github.io/baguetteBox.js/ for the lightbox of the gallery
- https://unsplash.com/ for my full main header image
- https://undraw.co/illustrations and https://icons8.com/icons for all of my SVG icons
